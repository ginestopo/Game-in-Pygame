A project in python to learn about pygame features and maybe complete a game :)

I had a new year resolution on 2020: I wanted to start creating my own videogames.
It is good to start using a game engine like Unity but first I consider more important
to learn about programming in order to understand how physics and game engines work.

This is a small game I've been developing during the year (when I had time). Sprites and code
are entirely made by me, Ginés Díaz.

Feel free to try it, modify it and show me your ideas! :)
